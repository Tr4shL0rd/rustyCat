# README

This is a simple command-line program that reads the contents of one or more files and prints them to the console.

## Usage

To use the program, pass the file paths as arguments on the command line:
```bash
./main file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
The program will read the contents of each file and print them to the console, separated by a horizontal line of dashes. If a file does not exist or cannot be read, the program will ignore it and move on to the next file.

## Dependencies

This program requires the following dependencies:
```rust
std::iter
std::fs
std::env
```
Ensure that these dependencies are available in your project before running the program.
